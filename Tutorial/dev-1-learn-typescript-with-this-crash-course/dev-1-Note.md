# Learn TypeScript With This Crash Course

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is becoming increasingly popular.

We've released a crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the TypeScript programming language. By the end of the course you will understand all modern TypeScript features.

This course was developed by Alexander Kochergin. Alexander has a lot of experience developing courses for his YouTube channel.

TypeScript is similar to JavaScript, but adds additional features. TypeScript is used by Microsoft, Asana, Lyft, Slack, and many other top tech companies. Additionally, it is the primary programming language used in Angular 2+.
